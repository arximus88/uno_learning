Binocular Camera Module:

Product Introduction

The OV2640 binocular camera module is made with two 1/4-inch OV2640 million HD CMOS sensors. It has high sensitivity, high flexibility, and support for JPEG output. It can work in the same way as binocular camera, and can be applied to many occasions such as binocular ranging, 3D measurement and so on. The camera can be driven by STM32, which is very convenient to use, and the camera configuration can be freely carried out, which greatly increases the flexibility of the application.
